'arbeit macht frei' is, despite everything, still beautiful

Knowing others is intelligence;
knowing yourself is true wisdom.
Mastering others is strength;

The truth is not always beautiful, nor beautiful words the truth.

To understand the limitation of things, desire them.

Close your mouth,
block off your senses,

I am a traveller in the lone desert

It's nothing special

I can stand the wind

I can stand the thirst

and the sun

I know how to go and walk

Until the setting of the sun

In the desert, flat and empty, where nothing is given

My head is alert, awake

I have climbed up and climbed down

The mountains where I was born

I know in which caves the water is hidden

These worries are my friends

I'm always on familiar terms with them and that

Gives birth to the stories of my life

You who are organised, assembled, walking together

Hand in hand, you're living

In truth, you're all alone

if the wind blows, ride it
